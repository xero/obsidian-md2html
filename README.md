# md2html

<img src="logo.svg" width="200">

a zero dependency plugin to export notes to html inside [obsidian](https://obsidian.md)! uses obsidian's own internal rendering calls, so your html will look exactly like it does in _your_ editor.

## usage

open the command pallet (default is control+p `^p` or command+p `âŒ˜p`)

and search **"md2html"**, this will give you 5 options:

- **convert document**: replaces current note's markdown with html
- **convert selection**: replaces currently selected text to html
- **convert to clipboard**: converts the current note's content to html and saves it to the clipboard
- **convert to new file**: converts the current notes's content to html and saves it to a new file named: `html-{note name}.md`
- **usage help**: displays the settings page

> **_tip!_** these can be mapped as shortcuts in the hotkey settings tab
