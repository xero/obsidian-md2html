an obsidian.md plugin for converting your markdown notes to html

## usage

open the command pallet (default is control+p `^p` or command+p `âŒ˜p`)
and type **"`md2html`"**, this will give you 4 options:

- **convert document**: replaces current note's markdown with html
- **convert selection**: replaces currently selected text to html
- **convert to clipboard**: converts the current note's content to html and saves it to the clipboard
- **convert to new file**: converts the current notes's content to html and saves it to a new file named: `html-{note name}.md`

> **_tip!_** these can be mapped as shortcuts in the hotkey settings tab.
